	<h2>Weekly meetings</h2>
	<p>Our weekly meetings are divided into two halves. In the first half of our weekly meetings, we go over OS topics, papers or projects which will be interesting for beginners. In the second half, we work on projects that people find interesting and which are more catered towards people with experience.</p>
